// Note about ESP32
//··································································································
//
// It appears that Arduino ESP32 interrupts are managed in a completely different way
// from "usual" Arduino:
//   - SPI.usingInterrupt is not implemented;
//   - noInterrupts() and interrupts() are NOPs;
//   - interrupt service routines should be fast, otherwise you get smothing like
//     "Guru Meditation Error: Core 1 panic'ed (Interrupt wdt timeout on CPU1)".

// So we handle the ESP32 interrupt in the following way:
//   - interrupt service routine performs a xSemaphoreGive on mISRSemaphore of can driver
//   - this activates the myESP32Task task that performs "isr_core" that is done
//     by interrupt service routine in "usual" Arduino;
//   - as this task runs in parallel with setup / loop routines, SPI access is natively
//     protected by the beginTransaction / endTransaction pair, that manages a mutex.
